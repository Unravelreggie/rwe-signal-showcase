# RWE · Signal methodology — synthetic public showcase

A toy report-level 2×2 table calculator demonstrating ROR and PRR using fabricated counts. It does not access VAERS or any other reporting database, estimate incidence, infer causation or perform medical signal confirmation.

This public repository contains **independently written demonstration code and entirely fabricated fixtures**. It is not a sanitized copy of a production system. No private Git history, company implementation, operational records, real study results, licensed terminology/templates, screenshots, secrets or infrastructure configuration are included.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.13 or later.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

The development server binds to local loopback. The application makes no runtime network requests, has no accounts and accepts no uploaded files. It is independently buildable and has no dependency on another project or data directory.
